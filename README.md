# 🌍 Translation Repository

This repository contains internationalization (i18n) files for multiple languages used across our application. The translations are maintained in JSON format for easy integration.

## 📂 Structure

The repository is organized by language code:


Each file contains key-value pairs used by the application for localization.

## 🏷️ Supported Languages

| Language   | Code | Description  |
|------------|------|---------------|
| English    | `en` | Default language |
| Spanish    | `es` | Español |
| Portuguese | `pt` | Português |
| Russian    | `ru` | Русский |

## 📝 Format

Each file follows the same JSON structure. Example:

```json
{
  "welcome": "Welcome",
  "login": "Log In",
  "logout": "Log Out"
}
